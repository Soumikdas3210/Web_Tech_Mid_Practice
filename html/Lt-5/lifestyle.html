                <h3>Why modern fatherhood isn't what it used to be</h3>

                    As far as the family is concerned, previous generations have expected men to be conditioned to express love only through actions. What they held in their hearts remained within, unspoken and never revealed. In this article, we look into whether the orthodox expectations of patriarchy still hold true, or whether we have fully broken free from them.

                    Traditional values define fatherhood within a rigid framework. Although someone who plays a significant role in every family, he is rarely seen as the one with emotional attachments. As the "master" of the household, he is considered the earner and the provider. And anything beyond is an additional bonus, but never enough on its own!

                <h3>Why guy trips with friends matter more than people realise</h3>
                <p><small>Published: November 18, 2025</small></p>

                    I am not one for Bollywood movies, but one movie in particular lives rent-free in my head — Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. Was it a particular masterpiece? Not really. But it stirred something in me that refused to fade — a yearning to hit the road. Not necessarily to Spain and go skydiving (although that's still on my bucket list), but to take a trip with my closest guy buds, cell phones off, and reality on hold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Would it really work the same? Does it have to be an international outing, or do local overnight stayovers count? Would it still feel different if the trip had girls along, or if it were with your partner or family? Being a realist (read pessimist), for a long time, I didn't think so, chalking it all up to 'movie magic.'

                <h3>“Not for bachelors!” How Dhaka's housing market humiliates men</h3>
                <p><small>Published: November 17, 2025</small></p>

                <p>
                    A walk in any alley around notable areas of the capital city shows a common sight: "To-let" signs and notices glued on walls, with one line that stands out every time — "Not for bachelors."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many young students and working professionals come to live in Dhaka city, away from their families, in pursuit of an education or employment. Although Dhaka wholeheartedly welcomes anyone who can afford it, the same cannot be said about landlords or neighbours. Life in Dhaka city is not easy for young men whose families do not live here.
