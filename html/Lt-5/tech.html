                <h3>Why the culture of glorifying overwork needs to stop</h3>
                <p><small>Published: November 26, 2025</small></p>
                <img src="https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_202/public/images/2025/11/25/photo_igor_omilaev_unsplash.jpg" alt="Overworked employee" width="300">
                <p>
                    The glorification of overworking and the expectation to stay late in the office have become long-ingrained in the corporate culture of many countries, including Bangladesh. But in this modern age, while many countries across the world are doing away with this culture, staying late is still often seen as a sign of dedication and hard work in Bangladesh. Is this relentless pursuit of productivity, however, hurting more than helping?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Historically, the practice of staying late at work was seen as a badge of honour, a tangible demonstration of one's dedication and commitment to their job and employer. This notion was rooted in the industrial age's emphasis on physical presence and hours logged as proxies for productivity and loyalty.
